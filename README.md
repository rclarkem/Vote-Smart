## Project Description

#### Overview:
The idea is to implement a simple single-page application (SPA) using the vanilla JavaScript.

#### Challenges:
Fetching and handling events using Vanilla Js, instead of using React, this project made sure to focus on fetching.

#### Purpose
This project allows users to see who their federal and local representatives are based on their address. They can also see what bills their representatives are working on in congress.

## Motivation
We wanted to create a project that would allow us to see some of our representatives and show us different information about them. The application displays the bills that the user's representatives are introducing in Congress, their representative's contact info, and their Twitter feeds.

## Features

The application takes a user's address and finds their representatives by using Google Civic API. The application can access the representative's bills through the ProPublica API.
